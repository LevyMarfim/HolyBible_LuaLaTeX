bigynnyng = [[\textbf{Bigynnyng} - beginning \phnm{/bɪˈɡɪnɪŋ/ (n.)}: The process of coming into existence; the Creation (of the world, etc.); the first; origin; source. Late 12c., ``time when something begins;'' c. 1200, ``initial stage or first part,'' verbal noun from begin. Meaning ``act of starting something'' is from early 13c. The OE word was \textit{fruma} (foremost). \textsc{Begin} \phnm{/bɪˈɡɪn/}: OE \textit{beginnan} ``to attempt, undertake,'' a rare word beside the more usual form \textit{onginnan} (class III strong verb; past tense \textit{ongann}, past participle \textit{ongunnen}); from \textit{be}- + West Germanic *\textit{ginnan}, which is of obscure etymology and found only in compounds, perhaps ``to open, open up'' (compare OHG \textit{in-ginnan} ``to cut open, open up,'' also ``begin, undertake''), with sense evolution from ``open'' to ``begin.'' Cognates elsewhere in Germanic include OF \textit{biginna} ``to begin,'' MD \textit{beghinnen}, OHG \textit{beginnan}, German \textit{beginnen}, OF \textit{bijenna} ``to begin,'' Gothic \textit{duginnan}. From late 12c. as ``originate, be the originator of;'' from c. 1200 as ``take the first step in, start to deal with.'' Intransitive sense ``come into existence'' is from mid-13c.]]

borun = [[\textbf{Borun} - born \phnm{/bɔːn/ (adj.)}: OE \textit{beran}, \textit{beoran}, \textit{beara}. To betake oneself (refl.); to carry (sth.), bring, carry away; be a bearer or carrier. OE \textit{boren}, alternative past participle of \textit{beran} (bear (v.)). ``In modern use the connexion with \textit{bear} is no longer felt; the phrase \textit{to be born} has become virtually an intr. verb'' [OED]. Distinction between \textit{born} and \textit{borne} (q.v.) is 17c. From early 14c. as ``possessing from birth the character or quality described'' (born poet, born loser, etc.). \textsc{Bear} \phnm{/bɛː/}: OE \textit{beran} ``to carry, bring; bring forth, give birth to, produce; to endure without resistance; to support, hold up, sustain; to wear'' (class IV strong verb; past tense \textit{bær}, past participle \textit{boren}), from Proto-Germanic *\textit{beranan} (source also of OS \textit{beran}, OF \textit{bera} ``bear, give birth,'' MD \textit{beren} ``carry a child,'' OHG \textit{beran}, German \textit{gebären}, ON \textit{bera} ``carry, bring, bear, endure; give birth,'' Gothic \textit{bairan} ``to carry, bear, give birth to''), from PIE root *\textit{bher}- ``carry a burden, bring,'' also ``give birth'' (though only English and German strongly retain this sense, and Russian has \textit{beremennaya} ``pregnant''). OE past tense \textit{bær} became ME \textit{bare}; alternative \textit{bore} began to appear c. 1400, but \textit{bare} remained the literary form till after 1600. Past participle distinction of \textit{borne} for ``carried'' and \textit{born} for ``given birth'' is from late 18c. Many senses are from notion of ``move onward by pressure.'' From c. 1300 as ``possess as an attribute or characteristic.'' Meaning ``sustain without sinking'' is from 1520s; to \textit{bear (sth) in mind} is from 1530s; meaning ``tend, be directed (in a certain way)'' is from c. 1600. To \textit{bear down} ``proceed forcefully toward'' (especially in nautical use) is from 1716. To \textit{bear up} is from 1650s as ``be firm, have fortitude.'']]

depthe = [[\textbf{Depthe} - depth \phnm{/dɛpθ/ (n.)}: Deep water, the sea; the primeval waters that preceded creation. Late 14c., ``a deep place, deep water, the sea,'' also ``distance or extension from the top down (opposed to \textit{height}) or from without inward,'' apparently formed in ME on model of long/\textit{length}, broad/\textit{breadth}; from \textit{dēp} ``deep'' + -th. Replaced older \textit{deopnes} ``deepness.'' Though the word is not recorded in OE, the formation was in Proto-Germanic, *\textit{deupitho}-, and corresponds to OS \textit{diupitha}, Dutch \textit{diepte}, ON \textit{dypð}, Gothic \textit{diupiþa}. From c. 1400 as ``the part of anything most remote from the boundary or outer limit.'']]

erthe = [[\textbf{Erthe} - earth \phnm{/əːθ/ (n.)}: OE \textit{eorþe} ``ground, soil, dirt, dry land; country, district,'' also used (along with \textit{middangeard}) for ``the (material) world, the abode of man'' (as opposed to the heavens or the underworld), from Proto-Germanic *\textit{ertho} (source also of OF \textit{erthe} ``earth,'' OS \textit{ertha}, ON \textit{jörð}, MD \textit{eerde}, Dutch \textit{aarde}, OHG \textit{erda}, German \textit{Erde}, Gothic \textit{airþa}), perhaps from an extended form of PIE root *\textit{er}- ``earth, ground.'' The earth considered as a planet was so called from c. 1400. The ME vocalism is in part influenced by OE \textit{yrþ} plowland, and perhaps also by an unattested adj.]]

forsothe = [[\textbf{Forsothe} - forsooth \phnm{/fəˈsuːθ/ (adv.)}: Archaic. From OE \textit{forsoð} ``indeed, in truth, verily, to tell the truth,'' from for ``for'' + soð ``truth'' (sooth). Regarded as affected in speech by c. 1600.]]

heuene = [[\textbf{Heuene} - heaven \phnm{/ˈhɛv(ə)n/ (n.)}: From OE \textit{heofon} ``home of God,'' earlier ``the visible sky, firmament,'' probably from Proto-Germanic *\textit{hibin}-, a dissimilation of *\textit{himin}- (source also of Low German \textit{heben}, ON \textit{himinn}, Gothic \textit{himins}, OF \textit{himul}, Dutch \textit{hemel}, German \textit{Himmel} ``heaven, sky''). The abode of God, heaven, paradise.]]

idel = [[\textbf{Idel} - idle \phnm{/ˈʌɪd(ə)l/ (adj.)}: OE \textit{idel} ``empty, void; vain; worthless, useless,'' from Proto-West Germanic *\textit{idla}- (source also of OS \textit{idal}, OF \textit{idel} ``empty, worthless,'' Old Dutch \textit{idil}, OHG \textit{ital}, German \textit{eitel} ``vain, useless, mere, pure''), a word of unknown origin.]]

nought = [[\textbf{Nouȝt} - nought \phnm{/nɔːt/ (n.)}: Archaic. Nothing. From OE \textit{nowiht} ``nothing,'' variant of \textit{nawiht}. Meaning ``zero, cipher'' is from early 15c.]]

theArticle = [[\textbf{Þe} - the \phnm{/ðə/, /ðɪ/, /ðiː/} (def. art.): Late OE \textit{þe}, nominative masculine form of the demonstrative pronoun and adjective. After c.950, it replaced earlier \textit{se} (masc.), \textit{seo} (fem.), \textit{þæt} (neuter), and probably represents \textit{se} altered by the \textit{th}- form which was used in all the masculine oblique cases. OE \textit{se} is from PIE root *\textit{so}- ``this, that'' (source also of Sanskrit \textit{sa}, Avestan \textit{ha}, Greek \textit{ho}, \textit{he} ``the,'' Irish and Gaelic \textit{so} ``this''). The \textit{þ}- forms, see \textit{that}. The \textit{s}- forms were entirely superseded in English by mid-13c., excepting a slightly longer dialectal survival in Kent. OE used 10 different words for ``the,'' but did not distinguish ``the'' from ``that.'' \textit{That} survived for a time as a definite article before vowels (\textit{that one} or \textit{that other}).]]

voide = [[\textbf{Voide} - void \phnm{/vɔɪd/ (adj.)}: c. 1300, ``unoccupied, vacant,'' from Anglo-French and Old French \textit{voide}, \textit{viude} ``empty, vast, wide, hollow, waste, uncultivated, fallow,'' as a noun, ``opening, hole; loss,'' from Latin \textit{vocivos} ``unoccupied, vacant,'' related to \textit{vacare} ``be empty,'' from PIE *\textit{wak}-, extended form of root *\textit{eue}- ``to leave, abandon, give out.'' Meaning ``lacking or wanting'' (something) is recorded from early 15c. Meaning ``legally invalid, without legal efficacy'' is attested from mid-15c.]]

watris = [[\textbf{Watris} - waters \phnm{/ˈwɔːtəz/ (n.)}: OE \textit{wæter}, from Proto-Germanic *\textit{watr}- (source also of OS \textit{watar}, OF \textit{wetir}, Dutch \textit{water}, OHG \textit{wazzar}, German \textit{Wasser}, ON \textit{vatn}, Gothic \textit{wato} ``water''), from PIE *\textit{wod-or}, suffixed form of root *\textit{wed}- ``water; wet.'']]

weren = [[\textbf{Weren} - were \phnm{/wə/ (v.)}: OE \textit{wæron} (past plural indicative of \textit{wesan}) and \textit{wære} (second person singular past indicative). The forms illustrate Verner's Law (named for Danish linguist Karl Verner, 1875), which predicts the ``s'' to ``z'' sound shift, and rhotacism, which changed ``z'' to ``r.'' \textit{Wast} (second person singular) was formed 1500s on analogy of \textit{be}/\textit{beest}, displacing \textit{were}. An intermediate form, \textit{wert}, was used in literature 17c.-18c., before \textit{were} reclaimed the job.]]
