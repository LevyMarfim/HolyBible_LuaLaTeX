## What's new in version 0.4.1
* Fixed issue with font size when calling _fn_ function from .lua file
* New layout for _fn_ function. It prints the etymology of the words of the verse

## To do list
* Create a .lua module to separate _Genesis.lua_ and _Etymology.lua_ from the main file
* Highlight the words referring to `God` in small caps
* Write a function in .lua file to print the etymologies of words in the verse by passing them as arguments
