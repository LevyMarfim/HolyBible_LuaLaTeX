## What's new in version 0.4.2

* Words referring to `God` are highlighted in small caps
* .lua files better documented with plenty comments
* New function in .lua file to print the chapter, verses and etymologies of words in the verse by passing them as arguments

## To do list
* Change main font to one that contains the glyphs needed in the text
* Improve the code that prints the etymology to better find the correct words that'll be in italic/bold shape
* Work on the .tex backend and implement the colors and styles first designed
